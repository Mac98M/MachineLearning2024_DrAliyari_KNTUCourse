The Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset from Kaggle contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders. It is highly unbalanced, with 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. The dataset features 30 attributes: 28 anonymized numerical features obtained through PCA, along with 'Time' and 'Amount'. The 'Class' attribute is the response variable, with 1 indicating fraud and 0 indicating non-fraud. This dataset is often used for benchmarking anomaly detection algorithms, focusing on the challenge of identifying fraudulent transactions in a highly imbalanced scenario. It was utilized in question 3 of this mini-project for applying dimensionality reduction techniques and implementing SVM models with various kernels.
