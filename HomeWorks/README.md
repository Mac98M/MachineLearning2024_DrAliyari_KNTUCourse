# Machine Learning Course: Mini Projects

Welcome to the repository for the Machine Learning course . This repository contains the implementation, analysis, and evaluation of various machine learning algorithms and techniques through four mini projects. Each mini project explores different aspects of machine learning, from classification and regression to neural networks and reinforcement learning.

## Project Overview

### Mini Project 1: Training and Evaluating Machine Learning Classifiers
- **Objective:** To train and evaluate various classifiers and regression models using synthetic and real-world datasets.
- **Tasks:**
  - **Linear Classifier:** Train and evaluate a linear classifier on a synthetic dataset.
  - **Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP):** Extend and prepare the CWRU Bearing dataset, then train and evaluate MLP models with different architectures.
  - **Regression Analysis:** Perform regression analysis on the Weather in Szeged dataset using techniques like Least Squares (LS), Regularized Least Squares (RLS), and Weighted Least Squares (WLS).

### Mini Project 2: Comparative Analysis of Machine Learning Classifiers
- **Objective:** To compare the performance of various machine learning classifiers on different datasets.
- **Tasks:**
  - **Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP):** Implement MLP with varying architectures and activation functions.
  - **Random Forest:** Train and evaluate Random Forest classifiers and compare with other ensemble methods like AdaBoost.
  - **Naive Bayes:** Apply Naive Bayes classifiers to the Heart Disease dataset and perform cross-validation analysis.

### Mini Project 3: Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Dimensionality Reduction
- **Objective:** To analyze the impact of various dimensionality reduction techniques on the performance of Support Vector Machines (SVM).
- **Tasks:**
  - **Dimensionality Reduction:** Implement and compare techniques like t-SNE, PCA, and LDA.
  - **SVM Implementation:** Evaluate SVM with linear and polynomial kernels, comparing custom-built polynomial SVM with scikit-learn implementation.
  - **Data Preprocessing:** Use autoencoders for data denoising and SMOTE for addressing class imbalance.

### Mini Project 4: Reinforcement Learning Algorithms
- **Objective:** To explore and implement reinforcement learning algorithms to solve the Wumpus World problem.
- **Tasks:**
  - **Q-learning:** Implement Q-learning to train an agent to navigate the Wumpus World environment.
  - **Deep Q-Networks (DQN):** Extend Q-learning by using neural networks to approximate Q-values, applying experience replay and a target network for stability.
  - **Performance Evaluation:** Train agents using these algorithms and evaluate their performance based on total rewards, cumulative rewards, and mean rewards per episode.
