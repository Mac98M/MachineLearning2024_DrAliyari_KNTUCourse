# Mini Project 1: Training and Evaluating Machine Learning Classifiers

Welcome to the Mini Project 1 repository. This project focuses on the training and evaluation of various machine learning classifiers and regression models using synthetic and real-world datasets. The project involves three main tasks, each exploring different aspects of machine learning.

## Project Overview

### Task Descriptions

#### Question 1: Linear Classifier
- **Objective:** To train and evaluate a linear classifier on a synthetic dataset.
- **Details:**
  - Generated a synthetic dataset with 3 features and 4 classes using the `sklearn.datasets` module.
  - Implemented and evaluated a linear classifier with different hyperparameters.
  - Visualized decision boundaries and classification results.

#### Question 2: Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) on CWRU Bearing Dataset
- **Objective:** To extend the dataset and perform feature extraction for training MLP models.
- **Details:**
  - Extended the CWRU Bearing dataset by adding more fault classes.
  - Performed feature extraction and data preparation.
  - Trained and evaluated MLP models with different architectures.
  - Implemented K-Fold and Stratified K-Fold cross-validation methods.

#### Question 3: Regression Analysis on Weather Dataset
- **Objective:** To perform regression analysis using various techniques.
- **Details:**
  - Analyzed the relationship between temperature and humidity in the Weather in Szeged dataset.
  - Applied techniques like Least Squares (LS), Regularized Least Squares (RLS), and Weighted Least Squares (WLS) to predict temperature.
  - Compared the performance of different regression models.
