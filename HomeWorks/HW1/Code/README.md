### Question 2: Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) on CWRU Bearing Dataset
- **Objective:** To extend the dataset and perform feature extraction for training MLP models.
- **Details:**
  - Extended the CWRU Bearing dataset by adding more fault classes.
  - Performed feature extraction and data preparation.
  - Trained and evaluated MLP models with different architectures.
  - Implemented K-Fold and Stratified K-Fold cross-validation methods.

### Question 3: Regression Analysis on Weather Dataset
- **Objective:** To perform regression analysis using various techniques.
- **Details:**
  - Analyzed the relationship between temperature and humidity in the Weather in Szeged dataset.
  - Applied techniques like Least Squares (LS), Regularized Least Squares (RLS), and Weighted Least Squares (WLS) to predict temperature.
  - Compared the performance of different regression models.
