# Mini Project 2: Machine Learning Classifiers

This repository contains the implementation of various machine learning classifiers including Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest, and Naive Bayes using Python. The project aims to provide a comparative analysis of these classifiers on a given dataset.
This project explores the implementation and evaluation of several machine learning classifiers. The goal is to compare their performance on a specific dataset and understand their strengths and weaknesses.
