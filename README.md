## Course Overview

This course aims to provide students with a robust understanding of machine learning fundamentals and advanced techniques. Key topics covered include:

- **Classifiers and Logistic Regression**: Exploring various classifiers, logistic regression models, and their applications.
- **Neural Networks and Bayesian Classifiers**: Understanding neural network architectures, activation functions, and Bayesian classifiers.
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Dimensionality Reduction**: Implementing SVMs with different kernels and using dimensionality reduction techniques such as PCA and t-SNE.
- **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**: Learning about RL algorithms and their applications in solving complex environments.

## Projects and Assignments

Throughout the semester, students will work on various mini-projects and assignments using programming languages such as Python and MATLAB. These projects are designed to provide hands-on experience with machine learning algorithms and their applications.

### Mini Projects Overview

#### Mini Project 1: Classifiers and Logistic Regression
- **Concepts Covered**: Classifiers, logistic regression, linear regression, and polynomial regression.

#### Mini Project 2: Neural Networks and Bayesian Classifiers
- **Concepts Covered**: Neural networks, activation functions (ReLU, ELU), McCulloch-Pitts neuron, perceptrons, multi-layer perceptrons, and Bayesian classifiers.

#### Mini Project 3: Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Dimensionality Reduction
- **Concepts Covered**: Support Vector Machines (SVM), kernel methods, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and t-SNE.

#### Mini Project 4: Reinforcement Learning and Its Algorithms
- **Concepts Covered**: Q-learning, Deep Q-learning, reinforcement learning, and policy performance analysis.

### Final Project

Students will also undertake a final project, which can be done individually or in pairs. The project should demonstrate a novel application or extension of machine learning concepts learned during the course. Detailed proposals and progress reports are required, with the final submission including a comprehensive report and presentation.

## Evaluation

The course evaluation is based on the following components:

- **Assignments and Projects**: 40%
- **Midterm and Final Exams**: 55%
- **Final Project**: 15%

**Total**: 110%
