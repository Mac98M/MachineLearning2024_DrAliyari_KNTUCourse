# Machine Learning 2024 - Dr. Aliyari KNTU Course
Welcome to the official repository for the Machine Learning 2024 course by Dr. Mehdi Aliyari at Khajeh Nasir Toosi University of Technology (KNTU). This repository serves as a comprehensive collection of academic assignments, projects, and resources related to the field of machine learning. Here, you will find detailed explorations and applications of various machine learning concepts and techniques.

## Course Overview

This course aims to provide students with a robust understanding of machine learning fundamentals and advanced techniques. Key topics covered include:

- **Introduction to Machine Learning Concepts**: Understanding the basics of machine learning, types of learning (supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement), and their applications.
- **Regression Analysis**: Exploring concepts such as least squares regression, logistic regression, gradient descent, and recursive least squares.
- **Classification Techniques**: Discussing linear classifiers, perceptrons, Bayesian decision theory, and density estimation methods.
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), and introductions to nonlinear dimensionality reduction.
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**: Learning about linear and kernel-based SVMs and their applications in classification tasks.
- **Neural Networks**: Understanding the physiology and development of neural networks, their mathematical models, and applications.
- **Instance-Based Learning**: Methods such as k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) and radial basis functions.
- **Fuzzy Systems**: An introduction to fuzzy logic, fuzzy rule-based systems, and their applications in control systems and pattern recognition.
- **Decision Trees**: Examining decision trees, their algorithms (e.g., ID3), entropy, and their advantages and disadvantages.
- **Ensemble Methods**: Discussing techniques like bagging, boosting, and algorithms such as AdaBoost.
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Covering the fundamentals of reinforcement learning and algorithms like Q-learning.
- **Evolutionary Algorithms**: An introduction to optimization methods based on evolutionary principles, including genetic algorithms.

## Projects and Assignments

Throughout the semester, students will work on various mini-projects and assignments using programming languages such as Python and MATLAB. These projects are designed to provide hands-on experience with machine learning algorithms and their applications.

### Final Project

Students will also undertake a final project, which can be done individually or in pairs. The project should demonstrate a novel application or extension of machine learning concepts learned during the course. Detailed proposals and progress reports are required, with the final submission including a comprehensive report and presentation.

## Evaluation

The course evaluation is based on the following components:

- **Assignments and Projects**: 40%
- **Midterm and Final Exams**: 55%
- **Final Project**: 15%

**Total**: 110%
